Package: libpcre2-8-0
Section: libs
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Multi-Arch: same
Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}
Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library- 8 bit runtime files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the 8 bit runtime library, which operates on
 ASCII and UTF-8 input.

Package: libpcre2-8-0-udeb

Section: debian-installer
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library- 8 bit runtime files (udeb)
 This package contains the 8 bit runtime library, for the Debian Installer.

Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - 16 bit runtime files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the 16 bit runtime library, which operates on
 UTF-16 input.

Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - 32 bit runtime files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the 32 bit runtime library, which operates on
 UTF-32 input.

Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - posix-compatible runtime files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library for the posix-compatible API.

Architecture: any
Multi-Arch: same
Conflicts: libpcre3-dev (<<2:8.35-8)
Depends: libc-dev, libpcre2-8-0 (= ${binary:Version}), libpcre2-16-0 (= ${binary:Version}), libpcre2-32-0 (= ${binary:Version}), libpcre2-posix3 (= ${binary:Version}), ${misc:Depends}
Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - development files
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the development files, including headers,
 static libraries, and documentation.

Package: pcre2-utils
Section: utils
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: New Perl Compatible Regular Expression Library - utilities
 This is PCRE2, the new implementation of PCRE, a library of functions
 to support regular expressions whose syntax and semantics are as
 close as possible to those of the Perl 5 language. New projects
 should use this library in preference to the older library,
 confusingly called pcre3 in Debian.
 .
 This package contains the utilities pcre2grep (like grep with PCRE)
 and pcre2test (a test program for the library, but also useful for
 experimenting with regular expressions). Both programs are also
 useful examples of programming with libpcre2.
